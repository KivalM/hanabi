# An evaluation of Deep-Q-Learning on the game of Hanabi

The repository contains the code for the project "An evaluation of Deep-Q-Learning techniques on the Hanabi Challenge". The project was developed as my final research project for Honors in Computer Science at the University of KZN.

The structure is as follows:
`best models/` contains the best models for each of the 7 experiments.
`hanabi/` contains the framework for training and testing the models.
`Paper/` contains the final paper submitted for the project.
